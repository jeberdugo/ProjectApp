# AuthGuard Test Fix

## Issue Fixed

The failing test "does not render children when not authenticated on protected routes" was failing because the AuthGuard component was always rendering children regardless of authentication status.

## Root Cause

The original AuthGuard component had this logic:
```tsx
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />
}

return <>{children}</>  // Always renders children!
```

This meant that even when a user was not authenticated and on a protected route, the children would still be rendered.

## Solution

Updated the AuthGuard component to properly handle authentication logic:

```tsx
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />
}

// Only render children if authenticated OR on a public route
if (isAuthenticated || publicRoutes.includes(pathname)) {
  return <>{children}</>
}

// Don't render anything for unauthenticated users on protected routes
return null
```

## Test Cases Covered

1. ✅ Shows loading spinner when loading
2. ✅ Renders children when authenticated
3. ✅ Renders children when not authenticated on public routes (/login, /register)
4. ✅ Does NOT render children when not authenticated on protected routes (/dashboard, etc.)

## Files Modified

- `frontend/components/auth-guard.tsx` - Fixed the authentication logic

## Expected Result

The failing test should now pass:
- When user is not authenticated and on a protected route (like /dashboard), the AuthGuard should return `null` instead of rendering the children
- The test `expect(screen.queryByText('Protected Content')).not.toBeInTheDocument()` should now pass

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility for all existing functionality
- Public routes (/login, /register) still work correctly for unauthenticated users
- Authenticated users can access all routes as before
- The useEffect for navigation redirects remains unchanged and continues to work
