# Test Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. AuthGuard Test - Loading Spinner Detection
- **Problem**: Test was looking for `data-testid="loading-spinner"` that didn't exist
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `data-testid="loading-spinner"` to the loading div in AuthGuard component
  - Updated test to use `screen.getByTestId('loading-spinner')`

### 2. LoginPage Test - Loading State Detection  
- **Problem**: Test was looking for `data-testid="loading-spinner"` that didn't exist
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `data-testid="loading-spinner"` to the Loader2 component in LoginPage
  - Updated test to use `screen.getByTestId('loading-spinner')`

### 3. AuthGuard Test - Authentication Logic
- **Problem**: Test "does not render children when not authenticated" was failing because it didn't account for public routes
- **Solution**: 
  - Split into two tests: one for public routes, one for protected routes
  - Added proper mocking of `usePathname` to test different route scenarios
  - Updated jest.setup.js to properly mock `usePathname` as a jest function

### 4. Jest Setup - Navigation Mocking
- **Problem**: `usePathname` wasn't properly mocked as a jest function
- **Solution**: Changed `usePathname: () => '/'` to `usePathname: jest.fn(() => '/')`

## Files Modified:

1. `components/auth-guard.tsx` - Added `data-testid="loading-spinner"` to loading div
2. `app/login/page.tsx` - Added `data-testid="loading-spinner"` to Loader2 component  
3. `__tests__/components/auth-guard.test.tsx` - Fixed loading spinner test and split authentication logic test
4. `__tests__/pages/login.test.tsx` - Fixed loading state test
5. `jest.setup.js` - Updated `usePathname` mock to be a proper jest function

## Expected Results:

- AuthGuard tests should pass with proper loading state detection and route-based authentication logic
- LoginPage tests should pass with correct loading state detection
- All tests should be more reliable with proper test IDs instead of CSS class selectors

## Test Coverage:

The fixes ensure proper testing of:
- Loading states in both AuthGuard and LoginPage
- Authentication logic for both public and protected routes
- Form interactions and error handling
- Navigation behavior

## Notes:

- Used `data-testid` attributes for more reliable test element selection
- Properly mocked Next.js navigation hooks for different test scenarios
- Maintained existing test structure while fixing the underlying issues
