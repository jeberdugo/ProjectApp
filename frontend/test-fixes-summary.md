# Test Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. AuthGuard Test - Multiple elements with role "generic"
- **Problem**: `screen.getByRole('generic')` found multiple div elements
- **Solution**: Changed to look for specific loading indicators instead of generic role

### 2. LoginPage Test - mockUseRouter.mockReturnValue is not a function  
- **Problem**: Incorrect mock setup for next/navigation
- **Solution**: Updated jest.mock to properly mock useRouter as a function

### 3. ProjectDialog Test - Label not associated with form control
- **Problem**: Select component didn't have proper id attribute for label association
- **Solution**: Added `id="status"` to SelectTrigger component

### 4. TaskDialog Test - Same label association issue
- **Solution**: Already had proper id attributes (`id="status"` and `id="priority"`)

### 5. Radix UI Dialog Warnings - Missing Description
- **Problem**: DialogContent components missing aria-describedby
- **Solution**: Added DialogDescription components to both ProjectDialog and TaskDialog

### 6. API Test - Navigation error in jsdom
- **Problem**: jsdom doesn't support navigation, causing console errors
- **Solution**: This is expected behavior in test environment, not a real issue

## Files Modified:

1. `__tests__/components/auth-guard.test.tsx` - Fixed loading spinner test
2. `__tests__/pages/login.test.tsx` - Fixed router mock and loading state test  
3. `__tests__/components/project-dialog.test.tsx` - Fixed Status label test
4. `components/project-dialog.tsx` - Added id to SelectTrigger and DialogDescription
5. `components/task-dialog.tsx` - Added DialogDescription (already had proper ids)

## Expected Results:

- AuthGuard tests should pass with proper loading state detection
- LoginPage tests should pass with correct router mocking
- ProjectDialog tests should pass with proper form control association
- TaskDialog tests should pass (already working)
- Radix UI warnings should be eliminated
- KanbanBoard tests should pass with proper drag/drop mocking

## Remaining Issues:

The API test console error about navigation is expected in jsdom environment and doesn't affect test functionality.
